### Mitigation Strategy Details

1. **API Rate Limits Exceeded**: 
   - This is a common risk when working with external APIs, especially if they have strict rate limits. Caching results or using backup APIs can reduce the number of requests made to the primary API.

2. **GUI Performance Issues**:
   - As the app grows, plotting or data-heavy operations may impact the UI’s responsiveness. Optimizing libraries and functions for plotting (e.g., using `matplotlib` efficiently) and reducing unnecessary refreshes can help mitigate this.

3. **Data Source/API Availability**: 
   - It's important to keep track of the health of your data sources. Using multiple backup APIs or local data storage (when applicable) can reduce reliance on a single data source. Adding retry logic will help recover from temporary failures.

4. **Data Inconsistency**:
   - Inconsistent or incomplete data from APIs can lead to incorrect results or poor user experience. Always validate data before processing, and handle errors gracefully.

5. **Security Vulnerabilities (API Key Leaks)**:
   - Ensure that API keys are stored securely and avoid hardcoding them directly into the codebase. Always use environment variables or a secure method to manage secrets.

6. **Network Latency/Connection Issues**:
   - Slow or unreliable network connections can delay the user experience. Provide users with visual indicators (e.g., loading spinners) and consider using retries or fallback options.

7. **User Input Errors**:
   - Users may input incorrect data (e.g., invalid stock symbols, city names). Providing input validation and helpful feedback (error messages) can minimize user frustration.

8. **Unhandled Exceptions or Crashes**:
   - It’s crucial to ensure that the application doesn’t crash unexpectedly. Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and manage errors, and log them for debugging.

9. **Codebase Bloat**:
   - Keep the codebase clean and efficient by only including necessary dependencies. Regularly review and remove unused libraries or modules to maintain performance.

10. **Version Compatibility Issues**:
   - Ensure compatibility with the expected Python versions and third-party libraries. Use virtual environments for testing different setups, and regularly update dependencies to ensure stability.

11. **Resource Limitations (Memory, CPU)**:
   - As the application grows, consider performance optimizations, especially if the user base increases. Profiling tools can help identify areas where resource usage could be reduced.

12. **User Interface Complexity**:
   - A cluttered or overly complex UI can lead to poor user experience. Focus on a simple, user-friendly design that aligns with user needs and expectations.

13. **Incomplete or Inaccurate Data Presentation**:
   - Ensure that data visualizations are correct and easy to interpret. Regularly test the display of charts and other data formats to ensure they present the right information.

### Monitoring and Response:
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor API health, application performance (response times, load times), and user feedback.
- **Response**: Create a contingency plan for major risks (e.g., switching to a backup API or rolling back a buggy feature). Regularly test all components to catch issues early.
