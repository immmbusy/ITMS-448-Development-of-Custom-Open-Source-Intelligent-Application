Data Analysis:
My method for analyzing data incorporates insights from multiple sources, including weather forecasts, stock market trends, news reports, and COVID-19 statistics.

The first step after collecting the data is to clean and prepare it. Using Python libraries like Pandas, I address missing values, remove duplicates, and resolve inconsistencies that could affect the accuracy of the analysis.

Next, I apply statistical techniques and use visual tools—such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices—to identify patterns. These might include connections like the influence of weather on stock market behavior or the correlation between COVID-19 cases and news coverage.

At this stage, I assess data distributions, detect outliers, and summarize key features of the dataset. To visualize findings, I use Matplotlib to create clear and insightful graphs and charts. Examples include:

Line charts to show stock price fluctuations over time

Heatmaps to illustrate COVID-19 trends across different regions

These visualizations make the data easier to understand and highlight significant trends or anomalies. For instance, analysis might show a potential link between weather patterns and stock market performance, or demonstrate how media coverage influences public response to the pandemic.
