‚ÄúPlease take a look at the demo video showcasing the output of my application (MP4 Video Demonstration Test).‚Äù

## üìå Project Overview

Collaboratively design, develop, and implement a custom open-source intelligent application in a high-level programming language such as Python. The application should feature a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI) and have the capability to retrieve and process data from at least four distinct data sources or APIs. You will be responsible for creating a comprehensive project plan, risk management plan, earned value sheet, and project management plan. Additionally, you will perform data analysis on the captured data and present your findings.

### üîë Key Features

- **GUI Development**: Using PyQt, Tkinter, or Dash (for web-based UI)
- **Multi-API Integration**: Examples include weather, finance, news, and open government data
- **Data Processing & Analysis**: Powered by Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn
- **Insight Visualization**: Interactive plots and dashboards
- **Open-Source & Collaborative**: Hosted on GitHub with full transparency

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Plan

### **Phase 1: Planning & Setup**
- Define project scope and choose APIs
- Assign team roles (Frontend, Backend, Data Analyst, PM)
- Initialize GitHub repo with `main`, `dev`, and feature branches
- Create initial documentation: `README.md`, `requirements.txt`

### **Phase 2: Development**
- Design and implement GUI
- Integrate APIs (handle authentication and data retrieval)
- Develop data processing module (cleaning and transformation)
- Create visualizations and data analysis scripts

### **Phase 3: Testing & Debugging**
- Unit testing with PyTest
- User testing and feedback collection
- Bug fixes and performance optimizations

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment**
- Finalize user and developer documentation
- Publish repository releases on GitHub
- Prepare project presentation and demo

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

| Risk                    | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                         |
|-------------------------|--------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| API Changes/Limitations | High   | Medium     | Use backup APIs, implement data caching     |
| GUI Performance Issues  | Medium | Low        | Optimize logic, use threading where needed  |
| Data Inconsistencies    | High   | Medium     | Validate data, implement robust error handling |
| Team Coordination       | Medium | Low        | Daily standups, track issues on GitHub      |
| Delays in Timeline      | High   | Medium     | Use Agile sprints and prioritize tasks      |
