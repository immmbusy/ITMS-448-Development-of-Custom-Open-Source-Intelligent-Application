# ITMS-448
Project Deliverables:
Project Plan: Create a detailed project plan outlining tasks, milestones, timelines, roles, and responsibilities. Include development phases, testing, and documentation.
Risk Management Plan: Identify potential risks that could impact the project's success. Develop strategies to mitigate, monitor, and respond to these risks.
Earned Value Sheet: Maintain an earned value sheet to track project progress, budget, and performance indicators.
Project Management Plan: Present an overall project management plan that includes communication strategies, team collaboration tools, and workflow guidelines.
Intelligent Application with GUI: Develop a fully functional open-source intelligent application with a user-friendly GUI. Ensure the application can retrieve and process data from at least four different data sources or APIs.
Data Analysis: Perform a comprehensive data analysis on the captured data using appropriate tools and techniques. Present your findings in a clear and insightful manner.
GitHub Repository: Maintain a version-controlled GitHub repository containing all code, documentation, and resources related to the project. 

# Project Plan: Open-Source Intelligent Application with GUI
1. Project Overview
We will develop an intelligent application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that retrieves and processes data from at least four different APIs/data sources. The application will perform data analysis and present insights in an interactive dashboard. The project will follow Agile methodologies, with version control on GitHub.

Key Features:
GUI Development (PyQt/Tkinter or Dash for web-based)

Multi-API Integration (e.g., Weather, Financial, News, Open Government Data)

Data Processing & Analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Insight Visualization (Interactive plots, dashboards)

Open-Source & Collaborative Development (GitHub)

2. Project Plan (Tasks, Milestones, Timeline)
Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Week 1)
Define project scope & select APIs

Assign roles (Frontend, Backend, Data Analysis, PM)

Set up GitHub repo (branches: dev, main, feature-based)

Create project documentation (README, requirements.txt)

Phase 2: Development (Weeks 2-4)
GUI Design & Implementation (PyQt/Tkinter)

API Integration (Requests, API keys management)

Data Processing Module (Cleaning, transformations)

Data Analysis & Visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Phase 3: Testing & Debugging (Week 5)
Unit Testing (PyTest)

User Testing (Feedback collection)

Bug Fixes & Optimization

Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment (Week 6)
Finalize documentation (User Guide, Developer Guide)

Host on GitHub (with releases)

Prepare presentation (Findings, Demo)

3. Risk Management Plan
Risk	Impact	Likelihood	Mitigation Strategy
API Changes/Limitations	High	Medium	Use fallback APIs, cache data
GUI Performance Issues	Medium	Low	Optimize code, use threading
Data Inconsistencies	High	Medium	Data validation, error handling
Team Collaboration Issues	Medium	Low	Daily standups, GitHub issues
Deadline Missed	High	Medium	Agile sprints, task prioritization
